Thank you to the staff at Eco Sanctuaries El Nido. You guys went above and beyond with your customer service. They took care of everything for us. Book our activities, arranged drop-off and pick-ups. Personalized breakfast, lunch and dinners by the beach. Simply Amazing!"</p>

The staff are very kind and were always smiling üôÇ and the owner is willing to assist us with special requests.

Loved that they have vegan options and can 'veganize' some of their food, they used coconut milk for my breakfast oatmeal üôÇ (thanks!) Nacpan beach and Eco Sanctuaries both have a very chill vibe but there are lots of things to do like yoga, sound bath, massage, hiking, etc. Some good things to mention about this place: friendly and helpful staff, clean, solar-powered, they grow their own herbs (lemon basil ftw!), and fresh air. We'll be back! üôÇ "</p>

We also took a Filipino & Thai massage, which were well received and very relaxing after the long trip getting there. The view, the water, the beach with a forest of palm trees was outstanding, very few people on the beach, it's like you're morrouned on a beautiful deserted island by yourself! They have also a decent wifi, because there is no cellular reception in Nacpan beach. We highly recommend it to anyone who wants to disconnect from the daily life and wants to recharge in a beach paradise! "</p>
