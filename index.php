Personalized breakfast, lunch and dinners by the beach. Simply Amazing!"</p>

The staff are very kind and were always smiling 🙂 and the owner is willing to assist us with special requests. Plus the food is exceptional so we didn&apos;t need to find other places to eat anymore. We had a really nice and peaceful stay ❤"</p>

Loved that they have vegan options and can 'veganize' some of their food, they used coconut milk for my breakfast oatmeal 🙂 (thanks!) Nacpan beach and Eco Sanctuaries both have a very chill vibe but there are lots of things to do like yoga, sound bath, massage, hiking, etc. Some good things to mention about this place: friendly and helpful staff, clean, solar-powered, they grow their own herbs (lemon basil ftw!), and fresh air. We'll be back! 🙂 "</p>

We also took a Filipino & Thai massage, which were well received and very relaxing after the long trip getting there. The view, the water, the beach with a forest of palm trees was outstanding, very few people on the beach, it's like you're morrouned on a beautiful deserted island by yourself! They have also a decent wifi, because there is no cellular reception in Nacpan beach. We highly recommend it to anyone who wants to disconnect from the daily life and wants to recharge in a beach paradise! "</p>
