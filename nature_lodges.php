        <p>This is the place for you if you want to relax, disconnect, hear sounds of birds when you wake up, sleep calmly to the sound of ocean waves and nature. Away from crowds in Nacpan and El Nido surrounded by nature in a beautiful beachfront location with a mountain as our backdrop and the ocean as our daily view.</p>
        <p>True to our ethos, we strive to be as eco-friendly as possible. We are 100% solar-powered utilizing renewable energy. We have no airconditioning, but the lodges were designed to be cool and comfortable, with thanks as well to the ocean breeze and fresh air circulating through the lodges.</p>
        <p>All beachfront lodges make use of natural and locally handcrafted products, supporting indigenous communities and promoting Filipino culture. Our coffee and tea in your rooms were sourced from local Filipino farmers and even the soap and shampoo were made by Palawan locals. The Eco Sanctuary experience is a Filipino showcase.</p>

              <li>Regular published rate is for 2 people. The lodge with sea view balcony can host up to 4 people at an additional charge of Php1500/person, with 2 queen beds. The cabin is best for 2 people with 1 queen bed.</li>
              <li>Our lodges are all screened and protected from mosquitos, and we also have additional mosquito net draped around the bed when needed. However, bear in mind that we have a mountain behind us and are subject to nature&apos;s elements. You may not see them as they avoid humans, but there may be a harmless endemic gecko which you can hear sometimes at night, or sandflies by the beach depending on the season which is common in some of El Nido&apos;s beaches such as Nacpan. They are harmless. If you are sensitive to them, you can bring insect repellant for protection and we also sell repellants, and our accommodations are screened and protected with mosquito net drapings in the rooms as well, but if you are highly sensitive this may not be the best place for you. We have had a lot of children stay, and have been unharmed by them, but do remember we are in a natural setting.</li>
              <li>We are not a luxury resort. We do not have televisions, refrigerators in the rooms, heater for showers, and airconditioning. Our accommodations are designed to be breezy and maximize air flow, fresh air, and the ocean breeze, and are equipped with stand fans.</li>
              <li>We have free purified water for all guests and in room coffee and tea accompanied by a thermos for hot water which is refilled daily, but not an electric devise.</li>

              <li>We have satellite wifi which are free to use for all guests but do not have signal from your cell provider given that we have a mountain behind us blocking the signal. The wifi is best for communications, emailing, social media.</li>
              <li>We do not currently allow newborns or those less than 2 years old, given that we understand that there may be more sensitivities to natural elements or allergies. We also do not have amenities such as cribs for babies. Thus, we do not accept. We can only accept shall a waiver be signed by the parents.</li>
              <li>Please add after the 5th bullet point: Given that our solar systems have maximum wattage capacity to ensure electricity 24/7 for the accommodations and no power disruptions, we hope you understand that appliances such as your own blowdryers, hair straighteners, electric kettles, and other heating devices with high wattage that can cause our system to overload may not be used.</li>
              <li>We are located in the more remote side of Nacpan beach and there is no road access to us. We arrange transfers from airport or town direct to our place through a 4x4 pickup for additional fee. For those going on your own through scooter or dropoff in the Nacpan public beach parking/entrance through your own van, please note that there is walking by the beach for about 10 minutes to get to us. Our staff can help with luggage and meet you if needed. We can help with all arrangements.</li>
